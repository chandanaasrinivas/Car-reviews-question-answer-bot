I've driven the Grand Vitara Strong Hybrid and it's not a lazy performer, atleast within the city like Gurgaon. Who knows, remapping it may throw some hybrid system errors? If someone is investing in a vehicle, it's always prudent to take a good test drive. If the dealership doesn't allow, shift to another dealer, go to some other city to test drive but the drive should be in conditions daily faced during the drive. If it's my vehicle, I'll definitely not tinker with the engine.\",\n          \"Quote: Originally Posted by Durango Dude Full EV's alone are a long way off, with the primitive grid system which can't handle A/C load in summer and trips, just think what will happen if even the EV population sees a spurt of 15-20% suddenly, it'll just collapse and the absolute \\\"opaque\\\" meter system at least in Chennai, we've been taken for a ride even during Covid, where the person who jots down readin inflates it and we were running from pillar to post to appeal for a reduction to no avail. The way forward for India is to incentivize the Full Hybrid instead of leap frogging to Full EV's which most probably our grids will not support. Yes, I agree when you say that the battery size and fuel savings must be confirmed by an independent Govt agency and then make it to the market. GST is not the 10 commandments it's changes or increases every month bringing newer and newer stuff into it's ambit so the Govt can't milk the udders till they bleed. Didn't mention anything about EVs in my post. Just Maruti's past behavior abusing hybrid-related tax exemptions where they didn't even bother providing a battery before calling their cars hybrid which resulted in the entire industry losing out on hybrid-related tax benefits. Hybrid as far as Maruti/Toyota is concerned is a technology to boost fuel efficiency and nothing else. This type of technology doesn't deserve any tax relief unless we provide similar tax relief to all fuel efficiency improvements in ICE cars. Just like GST is not the 10 commandments, we can't wait forever for monopoly discoms to magically improve the grid. There is no reason for them to do it because they don't have any competition. EVs will take off whether the grid is ready or not because India provides the biggest tax delta between ICE and EVs. We are seeing it already with 2Ws. If not for the supply chain constraints, we would've seen it in 4Ws as well. EVs have been growing exponentially in the last 2 years in India, not sure where you are getting info that another 20% increase will destroy grids.\",\n          \"Hyryder or Seltos Looking to upgrade from Grand i10. Budget around 16 lakhs OTR. Went to Lanson Toyoto showroom on ECR today to enquire about the S AT Neodrive variant.Being a Sunday only one sales person was available.No crowd. But the S variant was not there.Only a G variant was available in cave black colour. Me and wife liked the vehicle.Being on the wrong side of 60,the automatic being a torque converter appealed to me the most.The next thing I wanted to check was the back seat comfort.One major complaint in this vehicle I often hear on social media and wad in TeamBHP is the back seat head room. I am a tad above 5'10\\\" and in shoes I am stand nearly 6 feet.But I found the head room very adequate.The back seat did not give us any claustrophobic effect.The interior in the front was passable.Not able to avoid the feel that we were inside a Maruti.Driver side switches could have been really improved.Bonnet was clearly visible from the driver seat.Boot space was decent.It was obvious that the front doors were stronger than the back ones.A few taps on both the doors will make you aware of this.Realky don't know why these sort of compromises are being made by the manufacturers. I asked about adding alloys, changing the halogen to LED,fixing a 360 degree camera and changing to a bigger display.He advised not to go for a bigger display and the OEM one is adequate.Other things he readily agreed and quoted the below prices. 1.Alloys-16k/per wheel(I felt this was on a higher side) 2.Changing to LED headlights-10k. 3.360 degree camera-20 to 25k.(Does this cost this much in after market too?) 4.Bigger display-25 to 35k.(whew!). Waiting period quoted was 3 to 5 months. May test drive it in a few days. Then we visited Capital Kia in Adyar.Wanted to have a look at the HTk Plus IMT variant. In this vehicle I felt the roof being nearer to my head from the driving position.This is the second time I am having a look at the Seltos.We felt the room for 3 persons was slightly more than the Hyryder.But here the sales person said they won't change the halogen to LED and said the OEM headlights are enough.But in the market report the biggest complaint is the inadequate light throw in the HTk variant.The vehicle already has alloy wheels. Both the vehicles will have good road presence. When comparing the above vehicles in these particular variants these are the points to be noted. Hyryder. 17 inch wheels(But no alloys). Safety rating is expected to be at least 4 stars. Torque Converter Auto. Being an hybrid,will give more mileage than Seltos. GC is 210mm. All disc brakes. Dealer says a few accessories can be upgraded at the showroom itself. Wearing Toyota badge.(Though its a Maruti in disguise ) Default warranty for 3 years or one lakh kms. Extended Warranty for 31k-5 years or 2 lakh kms. From third service,we have to shell out 4 to 5 k. Seltos HTk Plus IMT. Alloy wheel(R16 compared to R17in UC.) 6 air bags.(Only two in UC) Sun Roof(Not in UC) All disc brakes. Bigger display. Being an IMT, more control? Can wait for the arrival of facelift this year. Default warranty-3 years with unlimited kms. I read a lot that this has an unstable shell.(Told by GNCAP?).That's a concern. Having said that,I am a sedate driver and most of my driving will be within Chennai.Even on highway I may not reach more than 90. I am leaving India by April and will be back only in September. I want to part with my much loved Grand i10 before leaving. So when I come back I can't afgord to wait to get a car home.Given up two wheeler riding and a vehicle is must in the household.So before leaving i want to book a car,so that I can take delivery once I come back. It is going to be a toss up between the above two.Will be immensely great full for any suggestions between the above two or any other car.Mostly this may be the last car I may be buying. Wanted go for either Kushaq or VW Virtus.(Seeing great reviews for Virtus).Kushaq AT is beyond my budget.As far as Virtus is concerned ingress and egress is a major concern for a person like me,who isn't getting any younger.

I've driven the Grand Vitara Strong Hybrid and it's not a lazy performer, atleast within the city like Gurgaon. Who knows, remapping it may throw some hybrid system errors? If someone is investing in a vehicle, it's always prudent to take a good test drive. If the dealership doesn't allow, shift to another dealer, go to some other city to test drive but the drive should be in conditions daily faced during the drive. If it's my vehicle, I'll definitely not tinker with the engine.\",\n          \"Quote: Originally Posted by Durango Dude Full EV's alone are a long way off, with the primitive grid system which can't handle A/C load in summer and trips, just think what will happen if even the EV population sees a spurt of 15-20% suddenly, it'll just collapse and the absolute \\\"opaque\\\" meter system at least in Chennai, we've been taken for a ride even during Covid, where the person who jots down readin inflates it and we were running from pillar to post to appeal for a reduction to no avail. The way forward for India is to incentivize the Full Hybrid instead of leap frogging to Full EV's which most probably our grids will not support. Yes, I agree when you say that the battery size and fuel savings must be confirmed by an independent Govt agency and then make it to the market. GST is not the 10 commandments it's changes or increases every month bringing newer and newer stuff into it's ambit so the Govt can't milk the udders till they bleed. Didn't mention anything about EVs in my post. Just Maruti's past behavior abusing hybrid-related tax exemptions where they didn't even bother providing a battery before calling their cars hybrid which resulted in the entire industry losing out on hybrid-related tax benefits. Hybrid as far as Maruti/Toyota is concerned is a technology to boost fuel efficiency and nothing else. This type of technology doesn't deserve any tax relief unless we provide similar tax relief to all fuel efficiency improvements in ICE cars. Just like GST is not the 10 commandments, we can't wait forever for monopoly discoms to magically improve the grid. There is no reason for them to do it because they don't have any competition. EVs will take off whether the grid is ready or not because India provides the biggest tax delta between ICE and EVs. We are seeing it already with 2Ws. If not for the supply chain constraints, we would've seen it in 4Ws as well. EVs have been growing exponentially in the last 2 years in India, not sure where you are getting info that another 20% increase will destroy grids.\",\n          \"Hyryder or Seltos Looking to upgrade from Grand i10. Budget around 16 lakhs OTR. Went to Lanson Toyoto showroom on ECR today to enquire about the S AT Neodrive variant.Being a Sunday only one sales person was available.No crowd. But the S variant was not there.Only a G variant was available in cave black colour. Me and wife liked the vehicle.Being on the wrong side of 60,the automatic being a torque converter appealed to me the most.The next thing I wanted to check was the back seat comfort.One major complaint in this vehicle I often hear on social media and wad in TeamBHP is the back seat head room. I am a tad above 5'10\\\" and in shoes I am stand nearly 6 feet.But I found the head room very adequate.The back seat did not give us any claustrophobic effect.The interior in the front was passable.Not able to avoid the feel that we were inside a Maruti.Driver side switches could have been really improved.Bonnet was clearly visible from the driver seat.Boot space was decent.It was obvious that the front doors were stronger than the back ones.A few taps on both the doors will make you aware of this.Realky don't know why these sort of compromises are being made by the manufacturers. I asked about adding alloys, changing the halogen to LED,fixing a 360 degree camera and changing to a bigger display.He advised not to go for a bigger display and the OEM one is adequate.Other things he readily agreed and quoted the below prices. 1.Alloys-16k/per wheel(I felt this was on a higher side) 2.Changing to LED headlights-10k. 3.360 degree camera-20 to 25k.(Does this cost this much in after market too?) 4.Bigger display-25 to 35k.(whew!). Waiting period quoted was 3 to 5 months. May test drive it in a few days. Then we visited Capital Kia in Adyar.Wanted to have a look at the HTk Plus IMT variant. In this vehicle I felt the roof being nearer to my head from the driving position.This is the second time I am having a look at the Seltos.We felt the room for 3 persons was slightly more than the Hyryder.But here the sales person said they won't change the halogen to LED and said the OEM headlights are enough.But in the market report the biggest complaint is the inadequate light throw in the HTk variant.The vehicle already has alloy wheels. Both the vehicles will have good road presence. When comparing the above vehicles in these particular variants these are the points to be noted. Hyryder. 17 inch wheels(But no alloys). Safety rating is expected to be at least 4 stars. Torque Converter Auto. Being an hybrid,will give more mileage than Seltos. GC is 210mm. All disc brakes. Dealer says a few accessories can be upgraded at the showroom itself. Wearing Toyota badge.(Though its a Maruti in disguise ) Default warranty for 3 years or one lakh kms. Extended Warranty for 31k-5 years or 2 lakh kms. From third service,we have to shell out 4 to 5 k. Seltos HTk Plus IMT. Alloy wheel(R16 compared to R17in UC.) 6 air bags.(Only two in UC) Sun Roof(Not in UC) All disc brakes. Bigger display. Being an IMT, more control? Can wait for the arrival of facelift this year. Default warranty-3 years with unlimited kms. I read a lot that this has an unstable shell.(Told by GNCAP?).That's a concern. Having said that,I am a sedate driver and most of my driving will be within Chennai.Even on highway I may not reach more than 90. I am leaving India by April and will be back only in September. I want to part with my much loved Grand i10 before leaving. So when I come back I can't afgord to wait to get a car home.Given up two wheeler riding and a vehicle is must in the household.So before leaving i want to book a car,so that I can take delivery once I come back. It is going to be a toss up between the above two.Will be immensely great full for any suggestions between the above two or any other car.Mostly this may be the last car I may be buying. Wanted go for either Kushaq or VW Virtus.(Seeing great reviews for Virtus).Kushaq AT is beyond my budget.As far as Virtus is concerned ingress and egress is a major concern for a person like me,who isn't getting any younger.
